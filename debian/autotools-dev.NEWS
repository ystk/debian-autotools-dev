autotools-dev (20130515.1) unstable; urgency=low

    GNU Config (config.sub and config.guess) has changed its license
    upstream to the GPLv3, with an added exception clause that allows
    the config.sub and config.guess files to be distributed under a
    different license in a specific condition: config.sub and
    config.guess can be included in programs that contain a
    configuration script generated by GNU autoconf under the license of
    the program itself.

    Please refer to the complete license which is included inside the
    config.sub and config.guess files themselves for details.

    This is not going to be a problem at all for any packages that use
    GNU autoconf/automake, nor it will be a problem for packages
    distributed under the GPLv3.  Howerver, it may become a problem for
    the rare packages which do not use GNU autoconf, are distributed
    with licenses other than the GPLv3, and need config.sub or
    config.guess.
